# DistributedR

Distributed R is a scalable high-performance platform for the R language. It enables and accelerates large scale machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph processing.

The Distributed R platform exposes data structures, such as distributed arrays, to store data across a cluster. Arrays act as a single abstraction to efficiently express both machine learning algorithms, which primarily use matrix operations, and graph algorithms, which manipulate the graphâ€™s adjacency matrix. In addition to distributed arrays, the platform also provides distributed data frames, lists and loops.

Using Distributed R constructs, data can be loaded in parallel from any data source. Distributed R also provides a parallel data loader from the Vertica database. Please see vRODBC repository.

## Installing from binaries

Distributed R is delivered in a single, easy-to-install tar file. The installation tool "distributedR_install" installs the platform and all parallel algorithm R packages. You can register and get the tar file [here](http://www.vertica.com/hp-vertica-products/hp-vertica-distributed-r/).

You can also get a Virtual Machine with everything installed [here](http://www.vertica.com/hp-vertica-products/hp-vertica-distributed-r/).

## Installing from source

1. Install dependencies:  
  * On Ubuntu:  

          $ sudo apt-get install -y make gcc g++ libxml2-dev rsync bison byacc flex

  * On CentOS:

          $ sudo yum install -y make gcc gcc-c++ libxml2-devel rsync bison byacc flex


2. Install R:
  * On Ubuntu:

          $ echo "deb http://cran.r-project.org//bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/r.list
          $ sudo apt-get update
          $ sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes r-base-core

  * On CentOS:

          $ curl -O http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
          $ sudo rpm -i epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
          $ sudo yum update
          $ sudo yum install R R-devel


3. Install R dependencies:

        $ sudo R  # to install globally
        R> install.packages(c('Rcpp','RInside','XML','randomForest','data.table'))

4. Compile and install Distributed R:

        $ cd platform/
        $ R CMD INSTALL executor
        $ R CMD INSTALL master

5. Open R and run an example:

        library(distributedR)
        distributedR_start()  # start DR
        distributedR_status()

        B <- darray(dim=c(9,9), blocks=c(3,3), sparse=FALSE) # create a darray
        foreach(i, 1:npartitions(B),
          init<-function(b = splits(B,i), index=i) {
          b <- matrix(index, nrow=nrow(b), ncol=ncol(b))
          update(b)
        })  # initialize it

        getpartition(B) # collect darray data

        distributedR_shutdown() # stop DR
